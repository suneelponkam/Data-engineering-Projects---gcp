Great! Let’s turn your 8-week GCP Financial Data Engineering study plan into a Notion board and also guide you to start Week 1’s mini project.

✅ Step 1: Notion Board Format
Here’s how you can structure the board in Notion:

🧱 Notion Columns:
Column	Description
Week	Week number (Week 1 to Week 8)
Focus Area	The theme of the week (e.g., GCP Fundamentals, BigQuery)
Goals	What you should learn by end of the week
Tools/Skills	Tools and platforms to focus on
Mini Project	Hands-on task for practice
Status	Not started / In progress / Completed

🧩 Sample Board Entry (Week 1)
Week: Week 1
Focus Area: GCP Fundamentals + Cloud Storage
Goals:

Understand core GCP services

Set up IAM roles

Learn GCS operations

Tools/Skills: GCP Console, Cloud Shell, gsutil, IAM, Terraform basics
Mini Project: Upload and version CSV files in Cloud Storage
Status: Not started

🔗 Notion Import Instructions:
Go to https://notion.so and open or create a workspace.

Create a new page → choose “Table” or “Board**” view.

Use the above format and manually enter each week’s info. (Let me know if you want a CSV you can import.)

✅ Step 2: Get Started with Week 1 — Mini Project
Goal: Upload and version CSV files to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

🔧 Steps:
Create GCP Project

Go to console.cloud.google.com

Enable billing, APIs (Cloud Storage, IAM)

Set Up Bucket

GCP Console > Cloud Storage > Create Bucket

Choose region & standard storage class

Upload CSV File

Upload a small dummy CSV (e.g., transactions.csv)

Use gsutil for CLI upload:

bash
Copy
Edit
gsutil cp transactions.csv gs://gcp-study-week1-yourname/
Enable Versioning (Optional but recommended)

bash
Copy
Edit
gsutil versioning set on gs://gcp-study-week1-yourname/
Check Object History

Re-upload with same name, then check version history from console

✅ Deliverables for Week 1
✅ GCP project created

✅ GCS bucket with versioning enabled

✅ At least one CSV file uploaded twice

✅ Screenshot or CLI proof of upload + version history

==========================================================================================================================================================================

✅ If you're preparing a resume or tailoring an application:
You should align your experience with these requirements. For example:

Resume Bullet Points (if you’re applying):
Designed and maintained scalable data pipelines using Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow for financial reporting workloads, ensuring high data quality and throughput.

Developed financial datasets and abstractions serving as single sources of truth for internal Finance and business stakeholders, improving strategic decision-making.

Built reusable libraries and tools enabling cross-team efficiency in constructing financial data pipelines on GCP.

Led end-to-end lifecycle of financial data products, from source ingestion to end-user documentation and stakeholder onboarding.

✅ If you're preparing for an interview:
Prepare for questions like:

How would you build a scalable data pipeline for billions of financial transactions using Dataflow or Beam?

How do you ensure data quality and reliability in financial datasets?

Can you walk me through a time you worked on financial data modeling (e.g., revenue, cost, royalties)?

What is your approach to managing ambiguity and working with cross-functional teams (e.g., finance + engineering)?

✅ If you want a full cover letter tailored for this role, let me know and I can draft one.
Also, the last sentence is cut off:

“Where You'll Be — This role is based in Lo…”

You might want to check the complete job post for the location. If this is from Spotify, YouTube, Google, or any music/streaming company, the financial domains like Premium, Ads, Royalties strongly suggest that.

Would you like help identifying the company or finishing the draft?

Great — you’re asking for a complete, detailed breakdown of what skills, services, and concepts you need to master to be fully prepared for a Data Engineer role like the one in the job description you shared. Based on the description, the focus is on:

Building scalable financial data pipelines

Working with billions of records

Operating in GCP, with tools like Beam, Dataflow, BigQuery

Designing data models, core datasets, and financial abstractions

Collaborating with Finance, Business, and Engineering teams

Following data product thinking and lifecycle management

🧠 What You Need to Learn — End-to-End Roadmap for the Role
🏗️ 1. Cloud Platform — Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Focus on the services that power data pipelines and analytics:
